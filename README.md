# Assignment-4-Crystals-Collector-Game

I. Crystals Collector Game
------------
1. In the jumbotron, there is a message box that changes its content from the initial page load when the player wins, loses, or starts a new game.
2. To the side, I put the sidebar there to track wins, losses, the goal number, and the total number.
3. There are two buttons on the right column that can restart the game or pop up rules.
4. Below are the four crystal balloon gifs that can be clicked on.

II. Resources
------------
1. The theme of this page is actually about this Korean game called Crazy Arcade. It's kind of hard to describe the game other than saying that it's very similar to Bomber Man(?). That's what my friends here have told me when we used to play the game together literally a decade ago. I didn't think the game was still going on, but it is! And I was luckily able to find some gifs and images here and there to use for this assignment.
2. I used http://www.online-image-editor.com/ to clean out my gifs from its initial source. This step actually took way longer than I would have liked it to, but I was determined to get these gifs as the crystal balloons. Initial gif downloads and its modified versions are all in the assets folder.
